        <span class="greycolor">A short story:</span>
        <h5><span id="specificlink">I had seen the Magic Shop from afar several times;
         I had passed it once or twice, a shop window of alluring little objects,
         magic balls, magic hens, wonderful cones, ventriloquist dolls,
         the material of the basket trick, packs of cards that looked all right,
         and all that sort of thing, but never had I thought of going in until one day,
         almost without warning, Gip hauled me by my finger right up to the window,
         and so conducted himself that there was nothing for it but to take him in.
         I had not thought the place was there, to tell the truth--a modest-sized frontage in Regent Street,
         between the picture shop and the place where the chicks run about just out of patent incubators,
         but there it was sure enough. I had fancied it was down nearer the Circus,
         or round the corner in Oxford Street, or even in Holborn;
         always over the way and a little inaccessible it had been, with something of the mirage in its position;
         but here it was now quite indisputably, and the fat end of Gip's pointing finger made a noise upon the glass.</span>></h5>
